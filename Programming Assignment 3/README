 File Submissions
==================
1. Sparse.java - Top level client module for pa3: reads infile data to two matrices, performs basic matrix operations, and outputs results to outfile.
2. Matrix.java - Matrix.java is a List of Entrys (basic operations have much faster runtimes if the matrix is sparse)
3. List.java - Doubly linked list of Objects (modified my List.java from pa1 to accomodate for Objects in the data field)
4. MatrixTest.java - Literally Isaak's super extensive ModelMatrixTest.java that was posted on github
5. ListTest.java - Literally Isaak's super extensive ModelListTest.java that was posted on github
6. Makefile - Unaltered makefile for pa3 from the class website
7. README - You're reading me right now!!
