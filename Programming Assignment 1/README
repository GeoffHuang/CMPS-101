CMPS 101 Professor Tantalo
Programming Assignment 1


==================
 File Submissions
==================

1. List.java - An integer doubly linked list ADT written by me. I referenced Professor Tantalo's Queue.java file on the class 
website examples. This file is used by Lex.java to sort a String array by insertion sorting the array indices into an integer List
object. I have checked my List class functionality with the ListClient.java provided on the class website. I have also checked it 
against the more extensive ModelListTest.java provided on Piazza by Isaak Cherdak (I passed 38/38 edge cases).
I did include the "List concat(List L)" function, but I wrote it very fast and did not test it. To my knowledge, it is not being
graded for this assignment though.

2. ListClient.java - This is a java file you provided on the class website to test functionality of List.java. I am turning in
exactly what I downloaded from the class website without alterations.

3. Lex.java - This is the program that reads strings from one file, and sorts the strings lexicographically in another file. 
However, it accomplishes this task indirectly by only insertion sorting the indices of the String array. I referenced FileIO.java
on the class website to familiarize myself with file IO commands in Java.

4. Makefile.txt - I am simply turning in the original makefile posted on the class website with no alterations in the hope that it 
works, since I have no prior experience with makefiles (although I did attend lab sections and watched Issak create one from scratch).
When I downloaded it from the class website, the automatic file extension it had me save it under was ".txt".

5. Makefile - In case it is not supposed to be a text file, I also saved it with no file extension. Hopefully, one of them fulfills
the makefile requirement properly, and you are able to run my code. I will make sure to attend future lab sections to fix my
confusion on the makefile matter.
